# Quiniela (football pool) for Russia World Cup

After 4 years of waiting we had another World Cup! Hooray!
To celebrate this I decided to do another football pool (or quiniela as called in
Mexico) and at the same time learn the basics of nodejs.

This is the api I created using nodejs to manage the quiniela. Please note that
this is one of my first approach to node so it's possible (definitely) that
there are some bad practices or better ways to make this. But if you are looking
for an example of using express, postgres and node I think this can help you.

Since I _"borrowed"_ all the style of my views and I can't find the
original author to credit, in the first release I have included only the
api endpoints so no rendering of views or log in is included.
On next releases I will include a much more simplified view and
the example of login using Google Oauth.
